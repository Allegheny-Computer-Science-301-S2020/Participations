## Introduction

The student will be committing participations in this directory. Unless otherwise noted in the assignment, we will not be using GatorGrader for participation works. 

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).


## Assistance
To do well on this task, you should also review the chapters of the course textbook and the relevant course slides. Please see the course instructor or one of the Technology Leaders or departmental tutors if you have questions. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
